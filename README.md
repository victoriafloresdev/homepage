## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I had the opportunity to explore the world of web development while creating a homepage for a news website. Here are some of the major takeaways from this experience:

### 1. Planning and Structuring HTML

I realized the significance of planning and structuring HTML documents before diving into CSS. A well-organized HTML layout makes it easier to apply styling and maintain consistency across the website. For instance, I structured the navigation menu using semantic HTML tags like `<nav>` and `<ul>` for better accessibility and SEO.

```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
    <!-- Other menu items -->
  </ul>
</nav>
```

### 2. CSS Mastery and Layout Techniques

My CSS skills improved significantly during this project. I learned to create responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox. These techniques allowed me to align and position elements with precision. For example, I used CSS Grid to structure the main news section, achieving a balanced and visually appealing layout.

```css
.main-news {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr;
  /* More CSS properties */
}
```

### 3. Unit of Measurement and Responsiveness

While working on the project, I realized the importance of responsive design. I intend to explore relative units like 'em' to ensure better adaptability to various screen sizes. This change can enhance the user experience and ensure the site looks great on different devices.

### 4. Problem-Solving and Persistence

One of the key takeaways from this project is the value of problem-solving and persistence. I encountered challenges along the way, but through research and experimentation, I overcame them. This experience reinforced my ability to troubleshoot and find creative solutions.

### 5. Code Organization and Best Practices

I applied good coding practices, such as using external CSS files and proper indentation, to maintain a clean and organized codebase. This ensures better code readability and easier maintenance in the future.

### Continued development

This project has been a valuable learning journey, helping me build a strong foundation in HTML and CSS while also cultivating problem-solving skills. I look foward to improve my skills in this area, specially in regards to using responsive units of measurements and the use of flex-box
